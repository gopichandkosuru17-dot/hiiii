## 🎯 **The Error You're Seeing**

When you see "Please start the backend server (python api.py)", it means:
- ✅ The beautiful frontend is working
- ❌ The AI backend isn't running
- 🔧 You need both parts for full functionality

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix for Full Functionality (Local)**

### Run Both Parts Together:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```cmd
cd C:\FakeAccountDetector\backend
python api.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```cmd
cd C:\FakeAccountDetector\frontend  
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Then open:** `http://localhost:8000`
